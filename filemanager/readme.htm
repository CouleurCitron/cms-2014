  EFZ FMS : Easy and Simple File management system was built to let you access 
  various files and directories on your website with ease and without requring 
  a ftp connection . I includes standard features like new file , new directory 
  , delete , edit , view and upload files . It was meant to be very simply integrated 
  and used without requring much configuration . The user interface is kept as 
  simple as possible .<br>
